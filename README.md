# Sokoban Game

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of the classic puzzle game Sokoban, developed using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The game features multiple levels, sound effects, and a graphical user interface.

## Key Features
- Multiple game levels with increasing difficulty
- Interactive welcome screen with menu options
- Background music and sound effects for enhanced user experience
- Smooth player and box movement controls
- Level progression and win condition detection
- Dynamic text rendering for game status and messages

## Technical Highlights
- Efficient use of C++ for game logic implementation
- Utilization of SFML for graphics rendering, event handling, and audio playback
- Modular code structure with separate files for game helpers and main logic
- Implementation of 2D array for level design and management
- Event-driven programming for user input handling

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Game Development fundamentals
- GUI programming with SFML
- Audio integration in applications
- File I/O operations for loading assets
- Problem-solving and algorithm implementation for game mechanics

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have SFML installed on your system
2. Clone the repository
3. Compile the source files (main.cpp and Gamehelpers.cpp)
4. Run the compiled executable

## Future Enhancements
- Additional levels and gameplay features
- High score system with data persistence
- Customizable player characters and themes
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements
